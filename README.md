# acadialogic-ipaas
A small, opinionated integration runtime that ingests events, normalizes them into canonical finance models, guarantees idempotent delivery, and provides an auditable run history. Built to be demoable, deployable, and believable to clients and hiring managers, while staying inside free or near-free cloud tiers.
